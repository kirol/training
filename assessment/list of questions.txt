tester vs developer
Attack the issue, not the person – never introduce a personal motif into any argument. “You always do this!” “It’s just like you to say that!” “He is so <unflattering adjective>!” Always keep things on a professional and courteous level.
Myatt advises, “Don’t play favourites, don’t get involved in drama, and certainly don’t tolerate manipulative, self-serving behaviour.”
Kohl adds, “I don’t tolerate personal attacks, and I don’t tolerate gossip.”


developer marks a bug as can not be reproduced on current build. Even though it is reproduced on previous build


developer does not fix your bug
more affected cases, say it important
sometimes emailing is better than commenting on bug
Hi and Thanks as much as possible

maintenance plan when you are free
invalid bug => maintenance plan for bug, test case, requirements

49% sure it is a bug
 please report the bug. I'd much rather have a ticket in the tracking system than a vague memory of a hallway conversation, or an interruption of what I'm working on


failed test case is marked as passed

found a problem but there is already an issue for it
updating affected version/build, logs, screenshots
updating affected environment/scenarios in details
do not forget to make a link to other dependence bugs or duplication bugs
