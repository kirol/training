ls
backup  text1       text2       text3  text5  xaa  yaa
sedtab  text[*?!1]  text[2*?!]  text4  text6  xab  yab

ls text[2-4]
text2  text3  text4

ls text[!2-4]
text1  text5  text6
This case only displays text1 text5 text6 not text[*?!1] , text[2*?!] because [ ] only represents one character

find and list -R returning different number of files

find lists all the files in the directory tree. ls -R actually lists fewer files: it omits dot files — you need ls -AR to include them.

If you aren't finding the files you need, there are a few possibilities:

    You missed them in the output. Use a search command (e.g. find … | less and use the / key in less). Keep in mind that the output of find is not sorted.
    The files aren't actually called what you think they're called. Do a case-insensitive search if you aren't sure about the case.
    The files you're looking for are actually symbolic links. Use find -xtype f instead of find -type f to categorize symbolic links as the file they point to.
    The files are under a symbolic link to a directory. Use find -L to traverse symbolic links, but be careful: this could search a very large number of files if you have a symbolic link to a directory that's at the top of a large hierarchy.

In no case would ls -R find files that find doesn't.

You can't easily compare the number of lines in output of ls -R and find:

    ls -R omits dot files, find doesn't.
    ls -R has a total of three extra lines for each subdirectory (except for the root), compared with find -type f: the directory entry, the blank line that separates the listing of that directory from the previous line, and the header line with the directory name followed by a colon.
