tester vs developer
developer marks a bug as can not be reproduced on current build. Even though it is reproduced on previous build
developer does not fix your bug

maintenance plan when you are free
invalid bug => maintenance plan for bug, test case, requirements

49% sure it is a bug
failed test case is marked as passed
found a problem but there is already an issue for it
